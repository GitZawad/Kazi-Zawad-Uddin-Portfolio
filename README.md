# Kazi-Zawad-Uddin-Portfolio

This is my first portfolio website and it's done with the help of headstarter ai as I have finished this project as the weekly task of the fellowship program they have selected me in. In this project I have used the kit of https://fontawesome.com/start to apply the icons and the github repository https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets for the form to connect with my google sheets. I tried to keep the website simple as I'm still learning. but I may make this website update in the future.
